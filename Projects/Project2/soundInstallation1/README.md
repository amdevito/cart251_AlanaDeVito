The Sonic Shape Invader: the Interactive Oscillator Game
Hit circles with your mallet to activate sine wave oscillators.
Hit triangles to activate triangle wave oscillators. Click to activate effects and visuals.
Letting the shapes hit the bottom of the screen will stop the oscillators.
Hitting them again will re-activate the same oscillator. Have fun!
