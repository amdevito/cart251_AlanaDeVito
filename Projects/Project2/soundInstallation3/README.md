# Installation 3 of 3: Spinning into Oblivion

by: Alana M DeVito

Spinning into Oblivion uses composed tracks and the user clicks on one of 4 sections of each record (the multi-circular design is intended to represent vinyl records) to play back the tracks at different rates, directions and combinations, replicating experimental turntablism .

Clicking the front half plays the tracks play forward, the back half plays them backwards, the upper section plays them faster and the lower half plays them slower. Mouse cursor changes the colour of active records.

Visualization of records (circular pattern movement) is reflective of the speed and direction of track playback.

Instructions visible when no records active and disappear when a record is activated.

Multitrack Composition composed by Am DeVito.
