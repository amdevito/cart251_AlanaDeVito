# CART 253 Final Project: The Sonic Shop Virtual Gallery

(CODE CREDITS BELOW)
By: Alana DeVito

Artist Statement:
The Sonic Shop Virtual Gallery is an online gallery space for the presentation and dissemination of interactive, digital AV artwork. The gallery space and 3 virtual sound and visual installations are created using the library p5.js, while the homepage for the gallery along with the character / patrons and host ‘hyperlink narrative’ interactions are created in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are 3 virtual installation pieces within the gallery that are accessed by clicking on the animated canvases imposed on the walls of the 3D rendered gallery space (created in Blender). The 3 installations are called, The Sonic Shape Invader, KelidoSCAPE Tunnel and Spinning into Oblivion. In the Sonic Space Invader, visitors use a paddle to bounce circles and triangles falling from the ‘sky’ to activate the corresponding oscillators – circle = sine wave, triangle = triangle wave. Clicking the mouse activates both the abstract video on screen and the effects applied to all the oscillators, with the cursor movement modulating the cut-off filter frequency. KelidoSCAPE Tunnel plays 8 tracks of a composed piece by clicking numbers 1-8 (the idea is that the users play with the combinations) on the keyboard and then the playback rate and direction and the effects parameters are modulated as the user moves their mouse back and forth across the screen. Lastly, Spinning into Oblivion is a piece that also uses composed tracks, but this time the user clicks on one of 4 sections of a record (the multi-circular design is intended to represent vinyl records) to play back the tracks at different rates, directions and combinations, replicating experimental turntablism . Clicking the front half plays the tracks play forward, the back half plays them backwards, the upper section plays them faster and the lower half plays them slower.
Another element of this larger art piece is the hyperlink narrative that allows users to interact with the virtual patrons and the ‘host’ of the gallery. Upon entering through the main home page (by clicking the Sonic Shop flashing banner on the lower right corner of https://amdevito.github.io/211/Final_Project/home/index.html), users are welcomed by the host and are introduced to the gallery and the current installation, as well as the underlying social commentary that they will have to engage with in order to interact with the entire web-art piece. This component asks the visitors to embody the identity of a trans-non-binary individual and experience how microaggressions effect peoples’ daily lives and public experiences. What the user is not aware of is that after 3 patron and 2 installation interactions a message pops up and informs them that after the exhaustion of being exposed to microaggressions through the patron interactions, they are emotionally exhausted and decide to leave. Essentially, a user can only experience 2 of the 3 installations after ‘speaking’ to all 3 patrons before the program tells them to leave, imitating the real-life way that microaggressions hinder the experiences of all different types of people (trans-non-binary being the focussed example here). Two other characteristics of the piece are intended to help the visitor empathetically embody their new identity: 1. They see themselves on-screen in a super-imposed video during the hyperlink narrative interactions and 2. Their cursor has a little pixel non-binary flag heart that changes to the trans flag on hover and changes to the genderfluid flag on click.
